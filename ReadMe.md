# Overlay Manager

> (Early extraction from existing personal project, not ready for prime time.)

Simple, small (< 3KB), overlay manager store for browser apps. Uses [Nano Stores](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores) for state management.

This is just the *data store* for simple overlays (tooltips, panels, dialogs, etc.)! Bring your own UI. It's not that hard, I have (or will have) documented a few examples:

- [Preact](./docs/preact-example.md)
- [React](./docs/react-example.md)
- [SolidJS](./docs/solidjs-example.md)

If your framework of choice isn't listed, looking at those examples will probably give you a good idea how to integrate it (there are [good](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores#vue) [examples](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores#svelte) for integrate Nano Stores in their docs, if you go looking).
